        When I first decided to pursue web development, I found my self perusing Apple’s website in awe at the interactive nature of the design. Parallax scrolling and animations have been a hallmark of Apple’s product websites for many years, and wanted to learn how to do that and implement it on my own websites.

        Fortunately for me, JavaScript Mastery posted a course on YouTube on using GSAP animations to build a clone of the iPhone 15 Pro website. The resulting website features animations for text and for videos that are made possible through GSAP.

        In addition, it does feature a 3D model of the iPhone 15 Pro that utilizes Three.js for the interactivity.

        This was an excellent primer on using animations in development projects. I enjoyed using GSAP and look forward to implementing this knowledge in future projects.
