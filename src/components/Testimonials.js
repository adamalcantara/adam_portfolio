          <p>"I had the pleasure of being Adam's Teaching Assistant when he attended UCF's in-depth, 12 week full stack web development bootcamp. Adam worked incredibly hard during his time with us and maintained the highest possible grade average. He and I often worked together outside of class on homework issues, which was a testament to the maximum amount of effort he put in. Adam is a team player. He has a great attitude, a strong work ethic, and is generally a delight to be around. He is a multi-talented individual with a strong background in photography, design, and development. Any employer who adds him to their roster will find great value added to their team."</p>
